# Open Perceptron Benchmarker

## About 

This is the Open Perceptron Benchmarker, or OpenPB, which is a command-line application written for the sole purpose of testing various neural network setups. The goal of this project is to make neural network assessment simple and flexible. 

## Anticipated Features

 - [ ] Multi-threading so the same setup can be trained/validated mutliple times at once
 - [ ] Human readable output to a CSV/Excel file (including things like average accuracy, run-to-run variance of training cycles, etc)

*Note: This application is still in early development. Unfortunately I don't have the time to work on this project consistently, so updates are periodic at best.*
