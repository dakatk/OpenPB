## Open Neural Network Benchmarker

This is the Open Neural Network Benchmarker, or ONNB, which is a command-line application written for the sole purpose of testing various neural network setups. The goal of this project is to make Neural Network assessment simple and flexible. 

# Some features anticipated for the final product are:
 - Setups for various types of neural networks (FFNNs, CNNs, RNNs)
 - The ability to load many JSON files from separate directories (one directoyr for network structures, one directory for training data, one directory for testing data) for training in parallel
 - Outputting the internal data of each layer at user-defined intervals

*Note: If you are considering downloading/using the code for this application, and are currently reading this, then that means the project is still in it's infancy and is not yet considered stable. At the time of writing, I'm still relatively new to Rust, and this project has only scarcely been tested at it's first milestone. Feel free to use/distribute this code at your own risk
